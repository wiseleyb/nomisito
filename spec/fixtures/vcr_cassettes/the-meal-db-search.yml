        through your lentils for any foreign debris, rinse them 2 or 3 times, drain,
        and set aside.  Fair warning, this will probably turn your lentils into a
        solid block that you\u2019ll have to break up later\r\nIn a large pot over
        medium-high heat, saut\u00e9 the olive oil and the onion with a pinch of salt
        for about 3 minutes, then add the carrots and cook for another 3 minutes.\r\nAdd
        the tomato paste and stir it around for around 1 minute. Now add the cumin,
        paprika, mint, thyme, black pepper, and red pepper as quickly as you can and
        stir for 10 seconds to bloom the spices. Congratulate yourself on how amazing
        your house now smells.\r\nImmediately add the lentils, water, broth, and salt.
        Bring the soup to a (gentle) boil.\r\nAfter it has come to a boil, reduce
        heat to medium-low, cover the pot halfway, and cook for 15-20 minutes or until
        the lentils have fallen apart and the carrots are completely cooked.\r\nAfter
        the soup has cooked and the lentils are tender, blend the soup either in a
        blender or simply use a hand blender to reach the consistency you desire.
        Taste for seasoning and add more salt if necessary.\r\nServe with crushed-up
        crackers, torn up bread, or something else to add some extra thickness.  You
        could also use a traditional thickener (like cornstarch or flour), but I prefer
        to add crackers for some texture and saltiness.  Makes great leftovers, stays
        good in the fridge for about a week.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/58oia61564916529.jpg","strTags":"Soup","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VVnZd8A84z4","strIngredient1":"Lentils","strIngredient2":"Onion","strIngredient3":"Carrots","strIngredient4":"Tomato

        day before you want to make the dish, scatter half the salt, half the garlic
        and half of the herbs over the base of a small shallow dish. Lay the duck
        legs, skin-side up, on top, then scatter over the remaining salt, garlic and
        herbs. Cover the duck and refrigerate overnight. This can be done up to 2
        days ahead.\r\nPour the wine into a saucepan that will snugly fit the duck
        legs in a single layer. Brush the salt off the duck legs and place them, skin-side
        down, in the wine. Cover the pan with a lid and place over a medium heat.
        As soon as the wine starts to bubble, turn the heat down to the lowest setting
        and cook for 2 hours, checking occasionally that the liquid is just barely
        simmering. (If you own a heat diffuser, it would be good to use it here.)
        After 2 hours, the duck legs should be submerged in their own fat and the
        meat should feel incredibly tender when prodded. Leave to cool.\r\nThe duck
        legs are now cooked and can be eaten immediately \u2013 or you can follow
        the next step if you like them crisp. If you are preparing ahead, pack the
        duck legs tightly into a plastic container or jar and pour over the fat, but
        not the liquid at the bottom of the pan. Cover and leave in the fridge for
        up to a month, or freeze for up to 3 months. The liquid you are left with
        makes a tasty gravy, which can be chilled or frozen until needed.\r\nTo reheat
        and crisp up the duck legs, heat oven to 220C\/fan 200C\/gas 7. Remove the
        legs from the fat and place them, skin-side down, in an ovenproof frying pan.
        Roast for 30-40 mins, turning halfway through, until brown and crisp. Serve
        with the reheated gravy, a crisp salad and some crisp golden ptoatoes.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wvpvsu1511786158.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MHhLJqghY-o","strIngredient1":"Sea

        tablespoons) of butter. With an electric mixer, pur\u00e9e with the milk.
        Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.\r\nWith the rack in the middle position,

        make the short crust pastry: measure the flour into a large bowl and rub in
        the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs
        (alternatively, this can be done in a food processor). Add about three tablespoons
        of cold water and mix to a firm dough, wrap in cling film and chill in the
        fridge for about 20 minutes.\r\nPreheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6 and
        put a heavy baking tray in the oven to heat up. Grease a deep 18cm\/7in loose-bottomed
        fluted flan tin with butter.\r\nRemove about 150g\/5\u00bdoz of pastry from
        the main ball and set aside for the lattice top.\r\nRoll the rest of the pastry
        out thinly on a lightly floured work surface and line the prepared flan tin
        with the pastry.\r\nPrick the base with a fork, to stop the base rising up
        during baking.\r\nPlace the reserved pastry for the lattice top on cling film
        and roll out thinly. Egg wash the pastry and set aside to chill in the fridge
        (the cling film makes it easier to move about). Do not cut into strips at
        this stage. Do not egg wash the strips once they are on the tart as it will
        drip into the treacle mixture.\r\nTo make the filling, heat the syrup gently
        in a large pan but do not boil.\r\nOnce melted, add the breadcrumbs, lemon
        juice and zest to the syrup. (You can add less lemon if you would prefer less
        citrus taste.) If the mixture looks runny, add a few more breadcrumbs.\r\nPour
        the syrup mixture into the lined tin and level the surface.\r\nRemove the
        reserved pastry from the fridge and cut into long strips, 1cm\/\u00bdin wide.
        Make sure they are all longer than the edges of the tart tin.\r\nEgg wash
        the edge of the pastry in the tin, and start to make the woven laying lattice
        pattern over the mixture, leave the strips hanging over the edge of the tin.\r\nOnce
        the lattice is in place, use the tin edge to cut off the strips by pressing
        down with your hands, creating a neat finish.\r\nBake on the pre-heated baking
        tray in the hot oven for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to
        colour, and then reduce the oven temperature to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. If at this
        stage the lattice seems to be getting too dark brown, cover the tart with
        tin foil.\r\nBake for a further 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden-brown
        and the filling set.\r\nRemove the tart from the oven and leave to firm up
        in the tin. Serve warm or cold.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wprvrw1511641295.jpg","strTags":"Tart","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YMmgKCNcqwI","strIngredient1":"Plain

        make the pastry, dice the butter and put it in the freezer to go really hard.
        Tip flour into the bowl of a food processor with half the butter and pulse
        to the texture of breadcrumbs. Pour in the lemon juice and 100ml iced water,
        and pulse to a dough. Tip in the rest of the butter and pulse a few times
        until the dough is heavily flecked with butter. It is important that you don\u2019t
        overdo this as the flecks of butter are what makes the pastry flaky.\r\nOn
        a floured surface roll the pastry out to a neat rectangle about 20 x 30cm.
        Fold the two ends of the pastry into the middle (See picture 1), then fold
        in half (pic 2). Roll the pastry out again and refold the same way 3 more
        times resting the pastry for at least 15 mins each time between roll and fold,
        then leave to rest in the fridge for at least 30 mins before using.\r\nTo
        make the filling, melt the butter in a large saucepan. Take it off the heat
        and stir in all the other ingredients until completely mixed, then set aside.\r\nTo
        make the cakes, roll the pastry out until it\u2019s just a little thicker
        than a \u00a31 coin and cut out 8 rounds about 12cm across. Re-roll the trimming
        if needed. Place a good heaped tablespoon of mixture in the middle of each
        round, brush the edges of the rounds with water, then gather the pastry around
        the filling and squeeze it together (pic 3). Flip them over so the smooth
        top is upwards and pat them into a smooth round. Flatten each round with a
        rolling pin to an oval until the fruit just starts to poke through, then place
        on a baking tray. Cut 2 little slits in each Eccles cakes, brush generously
        with egg white and sprinkle with the sugar (pic 4).\r\nHeat the oven to 220C\/200C
        fan\/gas 8. Bake the Eccles cakes for 15-20 mins until just past golden brown
        and sticky. Leave to cool on a rack and enjoy while still warm or cold with
        a cup of tea. If you prefer, Eccles cakes also go really well served with
        a wedge of hard, tangy British cheese such as Lancashire or cheddar.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wtqrqw1511639627.jpg","strTags":"Snack,Treat","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xV0QCJ0GD5w","strIngredient1":"Butter","strIngredient2":"Plain

        through your lentils for any foreign debris, rinse them 2 or 3 times, drain,
        and set aside.  Fair warning, this will probably turn your lentils into a
        solid block that you\u2019ll have to break up later\r\nIn a large pot over
        medium-high heat, saut\u00e9 the olive oil and the onion with a pinch of salt
        for about 3 minutes, then add the carrots and cook for another 3 minutes.\r\nAdd
        the tomato paste and stir it around for around 1 minute. Now add the cumin,
        paprika, mint, thyme, black pepper, and red pepper as quickly as you can and
        stir for 10 seconds to bloom the spices. Congratulate yourself on how amazing
        your house now smells.\r\nImmediately add the lentils, water, broth, and salt.
        Bring the soup to a (gentle) boil.\r\nAfter it has come to a boil, reduce
        heat to medium-low, cover the pot halfway, and cook for 15-20 minutes or until
        the lentils have fallen apart and the carrots are completely cooked.\r\nAfter
        the soup has cooked and the lentils are tender, blend the soup either in a
        blender or simply use a hand blender to reach the consistency you desire.
        Taste for seasoning and add more salt if necessary.\r\nServe with crushed-up
        crackers, torn up bread, or something else to add some extra thickness.  You
        could also use a traditional thickener (like cornstarch or flour), but I prefer
        to add crackers for some texture and saltiness.  Makes great leftovers, stays
        good in the fridge for about a week.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/58oia61564916529.jpg","strTags":"Soup","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VVnZd8A84z4","strIngredient1":"Lentils","strIngredient2":"Onion","strIngredient3":"Carrots","strIngredient4":"Tomato

        180C\/160 C fan\/Gas Mark 4. Line a deep loose-based 20cm cake tin with baking
        parchment.\r\nPut the butter in a large bowl and beat well until soft. Add
        the sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Stir in the orange zest and apricot
        jam.\r\nSieve together the flour and baking powder. Add the eggs to the creamed
        butter and sugar, a little at a time, beating well between each addition.
        If the mixture starts to curdle, stir in a little flour.\r\nAdd the remaining
        flour and ground almonds and mix well. Mix in the milk and then add the dried
        fruit and cherries and mix gently together.\r\nSpoon the mixture into the
        prepared tin and spread level using the back of a spoon. Arrange the whole
        almonds close together in neat circles on the top of the cake. Bake in the

        3 and cook for a further 60\u201380 minutes. Check the cake after 50 minutes
        by inserting a wooden or metal skewer into the cake. When it\u2019s done it
        should have just a few crumbs attached. Check every 10 minutes - it\u2019s
        important not to overcook this cake so the centre will be a little soft.\r\nWhen
        cooked, remove the cake briefly from the oven, put the milk and sugar into
        a small pan and heat gently until the sugar has dissolved. Brush over the
        top of the cake and return the cake to the oven for 2-3 mins. Remove and allow
        the cake to cool in the tin. When quite cold remove from the tin and wrap
        in foil and keep for at least 2 days before cutting.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wxyvqq1511723401.jpg","strTags":"heavy,Nutty,Fruity","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4hEXsfpeMQE","strIngredient1":"Almonds","strIngredient2":"Butter","strIngredient3":"Muscovado

        day before you want to make the dish, scatter half the salt, half the garlic
        and half of the herbs over the base of a small shallow dish. Lay the duck
        legs, skin-side up, on top, then scatter over the remaining salt, garlic and
        herbs. Cover the duck and refrigerate overnight. This can be done up to 2
        days ahead.\r\nPour the wine into a saucepan that will snugly fit the duck
        legs in a single layer. Brush the salt off the duck legs and place them, skin-side
        down, in the wine. Cover the pan with a lid and place over a medium heat.
        As soon as the wine starts to bubble, turn the heat down to the lowest setting
        and cook for 2 hours, checking occasionally that the liquid is just barely
        simmering. (If you own a heat diffuser, it would be good to use it here.)
        After 2 hours, the duck legs should be submerged in their own fat and the
        meat should feel incredibly tender when prodded. Leave to cool.\r\nThe duck
        legs are now cooked and can be eaten immediately \u2013 or you can follow
        the next step if you like them crisp. If you are preparing ahead, pack the
        duck legs tightly into a plastic container or jar and pour over the fat, but
        not the liquid at the bottom of the pan. Cover and leave in the fridge for
        up to a month, or freeze for up to 3 months. The liquid you are left with
        makes a tasty gravy, which can be chilled or frozen until needed.\r\nTo reheat
        and crisp up the duck legs, heat oven to 220C\/fan 200C\/gas 7. Remove the
        legs from the fat and place them, skin-side down, in an ovenproof frying pan.
        Roast for 30-40 mins, turning halfway through, until brown and crisp. Serve
        with the reheated gravy, a crisp salad and some crisp golden ptoatoes.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wvpvsu1511786158.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MHhLJqghY-o","strIngredient1":"Sea

        make the short crust pastry: measure the flour into a large bowl and rub in
        the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs
        (alternatively, this can be done in a food processor). Add about three tablespoons
        of cold water and mix to a firm dough, wrap in cling film and chill in the
        fridge for about 20 minutes.\r\nPreheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6 and
        put a heavy baking tray in the oven to heat up. Grease a deep 18cm\/7in loose-bottomed
        fluted flan tin with butter.\r\nRemove about 150g\/5\u00bdoz of pastry from
        the main ball and set aside for the lattice top.\r\nRoll the rest of the pastry
        out thinly on a lightly floured work surface and line the prepared flan tin
        with the pastry.\r\nPrick the base with a fork, to stop the base rising up
        during baking.\r\nPlace the reserved pastry for the lattice top on cling film
        and roll out thinly. Egg wash the pastry and set aside to chill in the fridge
        (the cling film makes it easier to move about). Do not cut into strips at
        this stage. Do not egg wash the strips once they are on the tart as it will
        drip into the treacle mixture.\r\nTo make the filling, heat the syrup gently
        in a large pan but do not boil.\r\nOnce melted, add the breadcrumbs, lemon
        juice and zest to the syrup. (You can add less lemon if you would prefer less
        citrus taste.) If the mixture looks runny, add a few more breadcrumbs.\r\nPour
        the syrup mixture into the lined tin and level the surface.\r\nRemove the
        reserved pastry from the fridge and cut into long strips, 1cm\/\u00bdin wide.
        Make sure they are all longer than the edges of the tart tin.\r\nEgg wash
        the edge of the pastry in the tin, and start to make the woven laying lattice
        pattern over the mixture, leave the strips hanging over the edge of the tin.\r\nOnce
        the lattice is in place, use the tin edge to cut off the strips by pressing
        down with your hands, creating a neat finish.\r\nBake on the pre-heated baking
        tray in the hot oven for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to
        colour, and then reduce the oven temperature to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. If at this
        stage the lattice seems to be getting too dark brown, cover the tart with
        tin foil.\r\nBake for a further 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden-brown
        and the filling set.\r\nRemove the tart from the oven and leave to firm up
        in the tin. Serve warm or cold.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wprvrw1511641295.jpg","strTags":"Tart","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YMmgKCNcqwI","strIngredient1":"Plain

        make the pastry, dice the butter and put it in the freezer to go really hard.
        Tip flour into the bowl of a food processor with half the butter and pulse
        to the texture of breadcrumbs. Pour in the lemon juice and 100ml iced water,
        and pulse to a dough. Tip in the rest of the butter and pulse a few times
        until the dough is heavily flecked with butter. It is important that you don\u2019t
        overdo this as the flecks of butter are what makes the pastry flaky.\r\nOn
        a floured surface roll the pastry out to a neat rectangle about 20 x 30cm.
        Fold the two ends of the pastry into the middle (See picture 1), then fold
        in half (pic 2). Roll the pastry out again and refold the same way 3 more
        times resting the pastry for at least 15 mins each time between roll and fold,
        then leave to rest in the fridge for at least 30 mins before using.\r\nTo
        make the filling, melt the butter in a large saucepan. Take it off the heat
        and stir in all the other ingredients until completely mixed, then set aside.\r\nTo
        make the cakes, roll the pastry out until it\u2019s just a little thicker
        than a \u00a31 coin and cut out 8 rounds about 12cm across. Re-roll the trimming
        if needed. Place a good heaped tablespoon of mixture in the middle of each
        round, brush the edges of the rounds with water, then gather the pastry around
        the filling and squeeze it together (pic 3). Flip them over so the smooth
        top is upwards and pat them into a smooth round. Flatten each round with a
        rolling pin to an oval until the fruit just starts to poke through, then place
        on a baking tray. Cut 2 little slits in each Eccles cakes, brush generously
        with egg white and sprinkle with the sugar (pic 4).\r\nHeat the oven to 220C\/200C
        fan\/gas 8. Bake the Eccles cakes for 15-20 mins until just past golden brown
        and sticky. Leave to cool on a rack and enjoy while still warm or cold with
        a cup of tea. If you prefer, Eccles cakes also go really well served with
        a wedge of hard, tangy British cheese such as Lancashire or cheddar.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wtqrqw1511639627.jpg","strTags":"Snack,Treat","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xV0QCJ0GD5w","strIngredient1":"Butter","strIngredient2":"Plain

        everything ready. Warm a 20cm (measured across the top) non-stick frying pan
        on a medium heat. Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them with a fork so
        they break up and mix, but not as completely as you would for scrambled egg.
        With the heat on medium-hot, drop one knob of butter into the pan. It should
        bubble and sizzle, but not brown. Season the eggs with the Parmesan and a
        little salt and pepper, and pour into the pan.\r\nLet the eggs bubble slightly
        for a couple of seconds, then take a wooden fork or spatula and gently draw
        the mixture in from the sides of the pan a few times, so it gathers in folds
        in the centre. Leave for a few seconds, then stir again to lightly combine
        uncooked egg with cooked. Leave briefly again, and when partly cooked, stir
        a bit faster, stopping while there\u2019s some barely cooked egg left. With
        the pan flat on the heat, shake it back and forth a few times to settle the
        mixture. It should slide easily in the pan and look soft and moist on top.
        A quick burst of heat will brown the underside.\r\nGrip the handle underneath.
        Tilt the pan down away from you and let the omelette fall to the edge. Fold
        the side nearest to you over by a third with your fork, and keep it rolling
        over, so the omelette tips onto a plate \u2013 or fold it in half, if that\u2019s
        easier. For a neat finish, cover the omelette with a piece of kitchen paper
        and plump it up a bit with your fingers. Rub the other knob of butter over
        to glaze. Serve immediately.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/yvpuuy1511797244.jpg","strTags":"Egg","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qXPhVYpQLPA","strIngredient1":"Eggs","strIngredient2":"Butter","strIngredient3":"Parmesan","strIngredient4":"Tarragon","strIngredient5":"Parsley","strIngredient6":"Chives","strIngredient7":"Gruy\u00e8re","strIngredient8":"","strIngredient9":"","strIngredient10":"","strIngredient11":"","strIngredient12":"","strIngredient13":"","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"3","strMeasure2":"2

        day before you want to make the dish, scatter half the salt, half the garlic
        and half of the herbs over the base of a small shallow dish. Lay the duck
        legs, skin-side up, on top, then scatter over the remaining salt, garlic and
        herbs. Cover the duck and refrigerate overnight. This can be done up to 2
        days ahead.\r\nPour the wine into a saucepan that will snugly fit the duck
        legs in a single layer. Brush the salt off the duck legs and place them, skin-side
        down, in the wine. Cover the pan with a lid and place over a medium heat.
        As soon as the wine starts to bubble, turn the heat down to the lowest setting
        and cook for 2 hours, checking occasionally that the liquid is just barely
        simmering. (If you own a heat diffuser, it would be good to use it here.)
        After 2 hours, the duck legs should be submerged in their own fat and the
        meat should feel incredibly tender when prodded. Leave to cool.\r\nThe duck
        legs are now cooked and can be eaten immediately \u2013 or you can follow
        the next step if you like them crisp. If you are preparing ahead, pack the
        duck legs tightly into a plastic container or jar and pour over the fat, but
        not the liquid at the bottom of the pan. Cover and leave in the fridge for
        up to a month, or freeze for up to 3 months. The liquid you are left with
        makes a tasty gravy, which can be chilled or frozen until needed.\r\nTo reheat
        and crisp up the duck legs, heat oven to 220C\/fan 200C\/gas 7. Remove the
        legs from the fat and place them, skin-side down, in an ovenproof frying pan.
        Roast for 30-40 mins, turning halfway through, until brown and crisp. Serve
        with the reheated gravy, a crisp salad and some crisp golden ptoatoes.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wvpvsu1511786158.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MHhLJqghY-o","strIngredient1":"Sea

        through your lentils for any foreign debris, rinse them 2 or 3 times, drain,
        and set aside.  Fair warning, this will probably turn your lentils into a
        solid block that you\u2019ll have to break up later\r\nIn a large pot over
        medium-high heat, saut\u00e9 the olive oil and the onion with a pinch of salt
        for about 3 minutes, then add the carrots and cook for another 3 minutes.\r\nAdd
        the tomato paste and stir it around for around 1 minute. Now add the cumin,
        paprika, mint, thyme, black pepper, and red pepper as quickly as you can and
        stir for 10 seconds to bloom the spices. Congratulate yourself on how amazing
        your house now smells.\r\nImmediately add the lentils, water, broth, and salt.
        Bring the soup to a (gentle) boil.\r\nAfter it has come to a boil, reduce
        heat to medium-low, cover the pot halfway, and cook for 15-20 minutes or until
        the lentils have fallen apart and the carrots are completely cooked.\r\nAfter
        the soup has cooked and the lentils are tender, blend the soup either in a
        blender or simply use a hand blender to reach the consistency you desire.
        Taste for seasoning and add more salt if necessary.\r\nServe with crushed-up
        crackers, torn up bread, or something else to add some extra thickness.  You
        could also use a traditional thickener (like cornstarch or flour), but I prefer
        to add crackers for some texture and saltiness.  Makes great leftovers, stays
        good in the fridge for about a week.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/58oia61564916529.jpg","strTags":"Soup","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VVnZd8A84z4","strIngredient1":"Lentils","strIngredient2":"Onion","strIngredient3":"Carrots","strIngredient4":"Tomato

        day before you want to make the dish, scatter half the salt, half the garlic
        and half of the herbs over the base of a small shallow dish. Lay the duck
        legs, skin-side up, on top, then scatter over the remaining salt, garlic and
        herbs. Cover the duck and refrigerate overnight. This can be done up to 2
        days ahead.\r\nPour the wine into a saucepan that will snugly fit the duck
        legs in a single layer. Brush the salt off the duck legs and place them, skin-side
        down, in the wine. Cover the pan with a lid and place over a medium heat.
        As soon as the wine starts to bubble, turn the heat down to the lowest setting
        and cook for 2 hours, checking occasionally that the liquid is just barely
        simmering. (If you own a heat diffuser, it would be good to use it here.)
        After 2 hours, the duck legs should be submerged in their own fat and the
        meat should feel incredibly tender when prodded. Leave to cool.\r\nThe duck
        legs are now cooked and can be eaten immediately \u2013 or you can follow
        the next step if you like them crisp. If you are preparing ahead, pack the
        duck legs tightly into a plastic container or jar and pour over the fat, but
        not the liquid at the bottom of the pan. Cover and leave in the fridge for
        up to a month, or freeze for up to 3 months. The liquid you are left with
        makes a tasty gravy, which can be chilled or frozen until needed.\r\nTo reheat
        and crisp up the duck legs, heat oven to 220C\/fan 200C\/gas 7. Remove the
        legs from the fat and place them, skin-side down, in an ovenproof frying pan.
        Roast for 30-40 mins, turning halfway through, until brown and crisp. Serve
        with the reheated gravy, a crisp salad and some crisp golden ptoatoes.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wvpvsu1511786158.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MHhLJqghY-o","strIngredient1":"Sea

        put a heavy baking tray in the oven to heat up. Grease a deep 18cm\/7in loose-bottomed
        fluted flan tin with butter.\r\nRemove about 150g\/5\u00bdoz of pastry from
        the main ball and set aside for the lattice top.\r\nRoll the rest of the pastry
        out thinly on a lightly floured work surface and line the prepared flan tin
        with the pastry.\r\nPrick the base with a fork, to stop the base rising up
        during baking.\r\nPlace the reserved pastry for the lattice top on cling film
        and roll out thinly. Egg wash the pastry and set aside to chill in the fridge
        (the cling film makes it easier to move about). Do not cut into strips at
        this stage. Do not egg wash the strips once they are on the tart as it will
        drip into the treacle mixture.\r\nTo make the filling, heat the syrup gently
        in a large pan but do not boil.\r\nOnce melted, add the breadcrumbs, lemon
        juice and zest to the syrup. (You can add less lemon if you would prefer less
        citrus taste.) If the mixture looks runny, add a few more breadcrumbs.\r\nPour
        the syrup mixture into the lined tin and level the surface.\r\nRemove the
        reserved pastry from the fridge and cut into long strips, 1cm\/\u00bdin wide.
        Make sure they are all longer than the edges of the tart tin.\r\nEgg wash
        the edge of the pastry in the tin, and start to make the woven laying lattice
        pattern over the mixture, leave the strips hanging over the edge of the tin.\r\nOnce
        the lattice is in place, use the tin edge to cut off the strips by pressing
        down with your hands, creating a neat finish.\r\nBake on the pre-heated baking
        tray in the hot oven for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to
        colour, and then reduce the oven temperature to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. If at this
        stage the lattice seems to be getting too dark brown, cover the tart with
        tin foil.\r\nBake for a further 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden-brown
        and the filling set.\r\nRemove the tart from the oven and leave to firm up
        in the tin. Serve warm or cold.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wprvrw1511641295.jpg","strTags":"Tart","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YMmgKCNcqwI","strIngredient1":"Plain

        Tip flour into the bowl of a food processor with half the butter and pulse
        to the texture of breadcrumbs. Pour in the lemon juice and 100ml iced water,
        and pulse to a dough. Tip in the rest of the butter and pulse a few times
        until the dough is heavily flecked with butter. It is important that you don\u2019t
        overdo this as the flecks of butter are what makes the pastry flaky.\r\nOn
        a floured surface roll the pastry out to a neat rectangle about 20 x 30cm.
        Fold the two ends of the pastry into the middle (See picture 1), then fold
        in half (pic 2). Roll the pastry out again and refold the same way 3 more
        times resting the pastry for at least 15 mins each time between roll and fold,
        then leave to rest in the fridge for at least 30 mins before using.\r\nTo
        make the filling, melt the butter in a large saucepan. Take it off the heat
        and stir in all the other ingredients until completely mixed, then set aside.\r\nTo
        make the cakes, roll the pastry out until it\u2019s just a little thicker
        than a \u00a31 coin and cut out 8 rounds about 12cm across. Re-roll the trimming
        if needed. Place a good heaped tablespoon of mixture in the middle of each
        round, brush the edges of the rounds with water, then gather the pastry around
        the filling and squeeze it together (pic 3). Flip them over so the smooth
        top is upwards and pat them into a smooth round. Flatten each round with a
        rolling pin to an oval until the fruit just starts to poke through, then place
        on a baking tray. Cut 2 little slits in each Eccles cakes, brush generously
        with egg white and sprinkle with the sugar (pic 4).\r\nHeat the oven to 220C\/200C
        fan\/gas 8. Bake the Eccles cakes for 15-20 mins until just past golden brown
        and sticky. Leave to cool on a rack and enjoy while still warm or cold with
        a cup of tea. If you prefer, Eccles cakes also go really well served with
        a wedge of hard, tangy British cheese such as Lancashire or cheddar.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wtqrqw1511639627.jpg","strTags":"Snack,Treat","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xV0QCJ0GD5w","strIngredient1":"Butter","strIngredient2":"Plain

        stir for 10 seconds to bloom the spices. Congratulate yourself on how amazing
        your house now smells.\r\nImmediately add the lentils, water, broth, and salt.
        Bring the soup to a (gentle) boil.\r\nAfter it has come to a boil, reduce
        heat to medium-low, cover the pot halfway, and cook for 15-20 minutes or until
        the lentils have fallen apart and the carrots are completely cooked.\r\nAfter
        the soup has cooked and the lentils are tender, blend the soup either in a
        blender or simply use a hand blender to reach the consistency you desire.
        Taste for seasoning and add more salt if necessary.\r\nServe with crushed-up
        crackers, torn up bread, or something else to add some extra thickness.  You
        could also use a traditional thickener (like cornstarch or flour), but I prefer
        to add crackers for some texture and saltiness.  Makes great leftovers, stays
        good in the fridge for about a week.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/58oia61564916529.jpg","strTags":"Soup","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VVnZd8A84z4","strIngredient1":"Lentils","strIngredient2":"Onion","strIngredient3":"Carrots","strIngredient4":"Tomato

        day before you want to make the dish, scatter half the salt, half the garlic
        and half of the herbs over the base of a small shallow dish. Lay the duck
        legs, skin-side up, on top, then scatter over the remaining salt, garlic and
        herbs. Cover the duck and refrigerate overnight. This can be done up to 2
        days ahead.\r\nPour the wine into a saucepan that will snugly fit the duck
        legs in a single layer. Brush the salt off the duck legs and place them, skin-side
        down, in the wine. Cover the pan with a lid and place over a medium heat.
        As soon as the wine starts to bubble, turn the heat down to the lowest setting
        and cook for 2 hours, checking occasionally that the liquid is just barely
        simmering. (If you own a heat diffuser, it would be good to use it here.)
        After 2 hours, the duck legs should be submerged in their own fat and the
        meat should feel incredibly tender when prodded. Leave to cool.\r\nThe duck
        legs are now cooked and can be eaten immediately \u2013 or you can follow
        the next step if you like them crisp. If you are preparing ahead, pack the
        duck legs tightly into a plastic container or jar and pour over the fat, but
        not the liquid at the bottom of the pan. Cover and leave in the fridge for
        up to a month, or freeze for up to 3 months. The liquid you are left with
        makes a tasty gravy, which can be chilled or frozen until needed.\r\nTo reheat
        and crisp up the duck legs, heat oven to 220C\/fan 200C\/gas 7. Remove the
        legs from the fat and place them, skin-side down, in an ovenproof frying pan.
        Roast for 30-40 mins, turning halfway through, until brown and crisp. Serve
        with the reheated gravy, a crisp salad and some crisp golden ptoatoes.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wvpvsu1511786158.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MHhLJqghY-o","strIngredient1":"Sea

        make the short crust pastry: measure the flour into a large bowl and rub in
        the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs
        (alternatively, this can be done in a food processor). Add about three tablespoons
        of cold water and mix to a firm dough, wrap in cling film and chill in the
        fridge for about 20 minutes.\r\nPreheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6 and
        put a heavy baking tray in the oven to heat up. Grease a deep 18cm\/7in loose-bottomed
        fluted flan tin with butter.\r\nRemove about 150g\/5\u00bdoz of pastry from
        the main ball and set aside for the lattice top.\r\nRoll the rest of the pastry
        out thinly on a lightly floured work surface and line the prepared flan tin
        with the pastry.\r\nPrick the base with a fork, to stop the base rising up
        during baking.\r\nPlace the reserved pastry for the lattice top on cling film
        and roll out thinly. Egg wash the pastry and set aside to chill in the fridge
        (the cling film makes it easier to move about). Do not cut into strips at
        this stage. Do not egg wash the strips once they are on the tart as it will
        drip into the treacle mixture.\r\nTo make the filling, heat the syrup gently
        in a large pan but do not boil.\r\nOnce melted, add the breadcrumbs, lemon
        juice and zest to the syrup. (You can add less lemon if you would prefer less
        citrus taste.) If the mixture looks runny, add a few more breadcrumbs.\r\nPour
        the syrup mixture into the lined tin and level the surface.\r\nRemove the
        reserved pastry from the fridge and cut into long strips, 1cm\/\u00bdin wide.
        Make sure they are all longer than the edges of the tart tin.\r\nEgg wash

        pattern over the mixture, leave the strips hanging over the edge of the tin.\r\nOnce
        the lattice is in place, use the tin edge to cut off the strips by pressing
        down with your hands, creating a neat finish.\r\nBake on the pre-heated baking
        tray in the hot oven for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to
        colour, and then reduce the oven temperature to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. If at this
        stage the lattice seems to be getting too dark brown, cover the tart with
        tin foil.\r\nBake for a further 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden-brown
        and the filling set.\r\nRemove the tart from the oven and leave to firm up
        in the tin. Serve warm or cold.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wprvrw1511641295.jpg","strTags":"Tart","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YMmgKCNcqwI","strIngredient1":"Plain

        make the pastry, dice the butter and put it in the freezer to go really hard.
        Tip flour into the bowl of a food processor with half the butter and pulse
        to the texture of breadcrumbs. Pour in the lemon juice and 100ml iced water,
        and pulse to a dough. Tip in the rest of the butter and pulse a few times
        until the dough is heavily flecked with butter. It is important that you don\u2019t
        overdo this as the flecks of butter are what makes the pastry flaky.\r\nOn
        a floured surface roll the pastry out to a neat rectangle about 20 x 30cm.
        Fold the two ends of the pastry into the middle (See picture 1), then fold
        in half (pic 2). Roll the pastry out again and refold the same way 3 more
        times resting the pastry for at least 15 mins each time between roll and fold,
        then leave to rest in the fridge for at least 30 mins before using.\r\nTo
        make the filling, melt the butter in a large saucepan. Take it off the heat
        and stir in all the other ingredients until completely mixed, then set aside.\r\nTo
        make the cakes, roll the pastry out until it\u2019s just a little thicker
        than a \u00a31 coin and cut out 8 rounds about 12cm across. Re-roll the trimming
        if needed. Place a good heaped tablespoon of mixture in the middle of each
        round, brush the edges of the rounds with water, then gather the pastry around
        the filling and squeeze it together (pic 3). Flip them over so the smooth
        top is upwards and pat them into a smooth round. Flatten each round with a
        rolling pin to an oval until the fruit just starts to poke through, then place
        on a baking tray. Cut 2 little slits in each Eccles cakes, brush generously
        with egg white and sprinkle with the sugar (pic 4).\r\nHeat the oven to 220C\/200C
        fan\/gas 8. Bake the Eccles cakes for 15-20 mins until just past golden brown
        and sticky. Leave to cool on a rack and enjoy while still warm or cold with
        a cup of tea. If you prefer, Eccles cakes also go really well served with
        a wedge of hard, tangy British cheese such as Lancashire or cheddar.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wtqrqw1511639627.jpg","strTags":"Snack,Treat","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xV0QCJ0GD5w","strIngredient1":"Butter","strIngredient2":"Plain
